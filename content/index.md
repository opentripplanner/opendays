This **September 7 and 8, 2023**, OpenTripPlanner (OTP) community members (developers, product owners, users, and any other interested party!) 
from around the world will meet in Valencia, Spain. OTP Open Days is a summit where we can meet up, 
exchange ideas, and plan for the future of open source trip planning.

The event is free to attend.

## Who will be there
OTP Open Days are open to all. The more you’re involved in using or evaluating OTP, the more you’ll get out of this event. 
But if Valencia is accessible to you and you’re interested in transportation customer information, consider joining us.

We are also planning to live stream a plenary session - check back on this website for final confirmation.

## What the program will look like
This two day conference will include at least 8 different small group sessions aimed at OTP developers and product owners. 
We’ll also have one plenary session including an overview of the latest updates to OTP and the roadmap for the next year.

## Where will we meet
OTP Open Days 2023 will be hosted by the OTP Project Leadership Committee at the **Universitat Politècnica de València (UPV)**.

The event will take place in building 7i, which can be found on [this interactive map](https://www.upv.es/plano/plano-2d-en.html). The building is closest to the Line 4 "Tarongers" tram station.

## Social events and MobilityData European workshop
Our partner MobilityData–the global steward of GTFS and GBFS–is co-hosting their European workshop with us at UPV! Their workshop will take place on September 5 and 6. Come for both!

We’ll also have a social event the evening of September 7 or 8. Join us for dinner, drinks, and discussion about everything we do besides trip planning technology! 

(OK–we’ll probably talk about trip planning a little bit at dinner, too…)

## Preliminary schedule 

We're in the process of detailing session descriptions on [this Trello board](https://trello.com/b/v2RsrrNm/otp-open-days-2023-valencia), with more details on session details coming soon. Planned topics include:

- OTP roadmap
- Flex routing
- OTP APIs and their future
- Support for Siri 2.1
- Developing an OTP business plan
- OTP’s contribution process
- OTP’s ecosystem and associated projects
- Performance improvements for large networks
